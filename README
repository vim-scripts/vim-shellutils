Overview

The vim-shellutils provides shell-like commands such as 'rm', 'ls', and so on. This plugin is written in pure Vim script. This is because you can execute shell-like commands as long as you have huge Vim 7.3+. In addition, thanks to this plugin, you can execute it without exiting the Vim. If you want to make some direcotries, all you have to do is type :Mkdir dirA dirB from cmd-line.

The Github repository for the autocdls is available at: 
  https://github.com/b4b4r07/vim-shellutils

Usage

* Ls

	:Ls[!] [{path}]
	
Show up some files in the {path} directory to cmd-line. If you want to show up all the files, including the files that begin with a dot in the {path} directory, then please put a bang. (:Ls!) If you omit the {path}, the current directory is specified as {path}.

* File

	:File [{path}]

Display {path} file information to cmd-line.If the {path} argument is omitted, set current buffer as {path}. The :File display many file information such as 'ls -l' of shell. 

For example,
	
	[file] rw-r--r-- 2014-08-15 17:02:58 (5KB) shellutils.txt

* Rm

	:Rm[!] [{path}]


Remove the {path} file. If the {path} argument is omitted, remove the current buffer. The :Rm inquires whether you really delete the {path} file. If you don't do this, then please put a bang. (:Rm!)

* Mkdir

	:Mkdir {path}

Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to cmd-line. With no FILE, read current buffer.

* Cp

	:Cp[!] {src}    {dest}
	:Cp[!] {src}... {directory}

Copy {src} to {dest}, or multiple {src}s to {directory}. Prompt whether to overwrite existing regular destination files. If you don't do this, then please put a bang. (:Cp!)

* Mv

	:Mv[!] {src}    {dest}
	:Mv[!] {src}... {directory}
